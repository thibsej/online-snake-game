Multiplayer Online Snake Game in Java

This Java code allows to play a multiplayer snake game using UDP. You have to collect as many apples as possible to grow, but you need to dodge other snakes and force them to hit your body to make them lose.

You can run this code with several computers connected on the same network. You need at least 3 to play the role of the server and two clients.

This repository is a project done in the Network programming course at Ecole Polytechnique.
